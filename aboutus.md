LAB02 Research is a small club of tech enthusiasts. We've built several tools over the years to improve existing platforms (like Home Assistant) or automate the little things through various hardware platforms like ESP*, Arduino and RPi.

Lately we started setting up ways to share our work with the rest of the community. This take a lot of time and effort, as 'works on our machines' isn't good enough, and UX has to be taken into account.

If you enjoy our work, consider sponsoring so we can invest in more hardware for our projects - which in turn get shared back :)
