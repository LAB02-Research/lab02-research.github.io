As is custom and somewhat mandatory; behold the 'first post' post! 

This GitHub pages based site will primarily be used to post updates on [HASS.Agent](https://github.com/LAB02-Research/HASS.Agent), a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) companion app for Windows. Besides the regular updates, posts about what's being developed (for instance, a post is coming up on how support for accessibility tools like screenreaders is being added), so you can see what's the holdup on a new release. 

And lastly random domotica related articles. 

Enjoy!
